  body: "Greetings comrade,\nSo listen up, boys, earth destruction will be the second
    worst thing that happens to you today. \n\nA Spy has breached our defenses...
    And worst of all, he could be any one of us. He could be in this very room! He
    could be you. He could be me!\n\nHe's blocking the window with some sort of propaganda
    and random post-its, we don't know for sure what its about, but we need to take
    'em down.\n\n[Click the papers on the window to remove them]\n\nGlory to EDD,\nJorge,
    EDD Minister"
