  body: "Hello there,\nIt seems to be getting kinda hot in the \"Office\" but we're
    not sure what it may be causing it. Maybe that newly installed thermostat has
    something to do with it. \n\nMaybe you should check it out and try to solve the
    problem --anyways, my coffee just got frozen i'll just wait for it to warm back
    up.\n\n[Use the Thermostat Controls to regulate the temperature]\n\nYour's dearly,\nJorge,
    EDD Minister"
