    Uh, let''s see. It appears a new disaster is aproaching.


    Blah,
    blah, blah. Now that might sound bad, I know, but it''s just the Moon here that
    gets a bit quirky at night, but do I blame it? No. If I were forced to rotate
    around a stupid rock for millions of years and I never got to have some kind
    of vacation? I''d probably be a bit irritable at night too.


    [Drag the moon
    away from Earth to prevent a possible impact]


    Your freaky boss,

    Jorge,
    EDD Minister'
