  body: "Greetings,\r\nThere's no time for formalities! A METEOR SHOWER is happening
    TONIGHT! I REPEAT, METEORS are hurdling toward Earth as we speak! We must --wait,
    is it tonight or tomorrow? Never mind!\r\n\r\nThis could be catastrophic! Potential
    extinction-level event! Should we evacuate? Should we hide? \n\n\u2014Anyways,
    forget the meteors for a second; we\u2019ve got deadlines. Yes, the sky might
    be literally falling, but that\u2019s no excuse for missing the TPS reports!
    If the world\u2019s ending, we need to end it on a high note\u2014with our best
    quarter yet!\n\n[Click on the incoming meteors to destroy them]\n\nBack to work,\nJorge,
    EDD Minister"
